# Frequently asked Questions

Q: Do I lose any purchased tracks when I uninstall Beat Saber / mod the game?   
A: No, you keep all purchased items when modding, but you can't play songs introduced in the version after the one you downgrade to.  

Q: Go to settings isn't working.  
A: Use [Quest Settings Opener](<https://github.com/SmokeSlate/QuestDevSettings/releases/download/2.0/OpenSettings.apk>). [Steps on how here.](<https://wiki.sm0ke.org/#/quest?id=_5-using-dev-tools-opener-to-enable-developer-mode>)  

Q: Does it work with multiple accounts?  
A: There is *limited to **no*** support with multiple accounts. There has been success on headset admin accounts so try that.  

Q: **I can't find `VR Android File Manager`!**  
A: Download `Mobile VR Station` and go to your library, click on the `...` and then `Settings` then `Release Channels` then select the one that is not selected (NOT `live`) and then click `Confirm`. Go back to your library and click the `...` again and then click `Update`. Once updated open the app navigate to `All Folders > Android > data` then click on `Scoped Actions` then `Request Permission`. Then install your apks.  


### Troubleshooting
**Try this:**
- Do you have multiple accounts?
- Are you on the latest version?
- Have you tried restarting your headset?
- Did you uninstall → reinstall Beat Saber?
- What have you done so far/when did it break?
- **Take screenshots of what’s wrong or errors!** this helps us diagnose.
