### Developer Mode

To mod your game, you'll need to activate Developer Mode on your Quest.
If you haven't done this already, follow the steps below:

1. Go to the [Meta's Developer Website](https://developer.oculus.com/manage/organizations/create/) and log in with the
   Meta account that your Quest is bound to.
2. If you haven't already, set up 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) on your Meta Account, as it's required to create an Organization.

   Organization. The name you choose for it doesn't matter.
