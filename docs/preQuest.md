## Quest Preparations (With PC) 
To mod your game, you'll need to activate Developer Mode on your Quest.  

!> **Multiple Accounts**  
Beat Saber cannot be modded if you have multiple accounts on your device! You will need to temporarily remove any secondary accounts before modding.  
  
?> **Note:** If you have already activated Developer Mode on your Quest, you can skip this section and continue to the next one.  

If you haven't done this already, follow the steps below: 
1. Go to the [Meta's Developer Website](https://developer.oculus.com/manage/organizations/create/) and log in with the
   Meta account that your Quest is bound to.
2. If you haven't already, set up 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) on your Meta Account, as it's required to create an Organization.

3. Return to the [Meta's Developer Website](https://developer.oculus.com/manage/organizations/create/) and create a new
   Organization. The name you choose for it doesn't matter.
